# 👻 GhostTrial – Anti-Cheat & Memory Scan Learning Tool

**GhostTrial** is a custom-built Python suite designed to analyze and learn from process memory in PvE games like **The Outlast Trials**, **Toontown Rewritten**, and **Toontown Corporate Clash**.  
Built for **educational and ethical research only**, it helps users understand how memory is handled in client-side processes — with a spooky GUI twist. 💀🎮

---

## 🎯 Purpose

> GhostTrial is not a cheat. It is a **forensic research tool** for studying memory in games without competitive ecosystems.

### ✅ Perfect For:
- Reverse engineering learners 🧠
- Game forensics hobbyists 🎮
- Modding fans & PvE sandbox explorers
- Speaking/presenting about how client-side values work

## 🖥️ How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GhostTrial.git
cd GhostTrial
pip install -r requirements.txt
python ghosttrial.py
💡 Requires:

Python 3.8–3.11

🧪 Educational Memory Scan Examples
You can test scan values like 9999 Murkov Coins or 137 Laff — these are not hacks, they’re forensic targets.

Example: Scan for Outlast Trials Tokens

👻 Notes & Disclaimers
🛡️ GhostTrial does not modify memory, only reads it.

❗ Do not use this in online games with anti-cheat or multiplayer flags.

⚖️ Built strictly for learning how PvE progression systems store values.

💙 Community Message
"This project is for testing, talking, and tinkering.
It exists to learn, not exploit.
If we can understand how PvE memory works — we can understand how to defend, balance, and fix games too."
